# üì± Mobile PWA Installation Guide

## üîß PWA 404 Error - Fixed!

### What Was Wrong
The PWA had a base path mismatch:
- App was running at `/MyTradeJournal/` (for GitHub Pages)
- But during development, it should run at `/` (root)
- This caused 404 errors when installing on mobile

### ‚úÖ Fix Applied
Updated configuration to use different paths for development vs production:
- **Development**: `/` (root path)
- **Production**: `/MyTradeJournal/` (GitHub Pages path)

## üì± How to Test PWA Installation on Mobile

### For Android (Chrome/Edge)
1. Open Chrome/Edge on your phone
2. Navigate to: `http://[YOUR_COMPUTER_IP]:5174/`
3. Look for "Add to Home Screen" option in browser menu
4. Or wait for automatic install prompt
5. Tap "Install" or "Add"

### For iOS (Safari)
1. Open Safari on your iPhone/iPad
2. Navigate to: `http://[YOUR_COMPUTER_IP]:5174/`
3. Tap the Share button (square with arrow up)
4. Select "Add to Home Screen"
5. Tap "Add"

### Finding Your Computer's IP Address
Run this command in PowerShell:
```powershell
ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"
```

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Test Local Installation
```bash
# Your app is now running at:
http://localhost:5174/

# Test these pages work:
http://localhost:5174/        # Main app
http://localhost:5174/debug   # Debug page
```

### 2. Test Mobile Access
```bash
# Replace [YOUR_IP] with your actual IP address
http://[YOUR_IP]:5174/
```

### 3. PWA Install Prompt
- Should appear automatically on mobile browsers
- Or available through browser menu
- No more 404 errors!

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?
1. Clear browser cache
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Check that port 5174 is accessible
4. Ensure firewall allows connections

### No Install Prompt?
1. Visit the site a few times
2. Interact with the page (scroll, click)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try different mobile browser

### Network Issues?
```powershell
# Check if dev server allows network access
npm run dev -- --host

# This should show:
# ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5174/
# ‚ûú  Network: http://[YOUR_IP]:5174/
```

## üìã Current Status
- ‚úÖ Base path fixed for development
- ‚úÖ Manifest URLs corrected
- ‚úÖ PWA configuration updated
- ‚úÖ Ready for mobile installation

Your PWA should now install properly on mobile devices without 404 errors!
