# Firebase Initialization Fix

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Issue:** `Firebase: No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created`
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem

The application was throwing a runtime error:
```
Uncaught FirebaseError: Firebase: No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created - call initializeApp() first (app/no-app).
    at getAuth (chunk-ROS2IFIU.js?v=99cc2839:1981:25)
    at getAuth (firebase_auth.js?v=99cc2839:8079:24)
    at authService.ts:12:14
```

### Root Cause

The `authService.ts` file was calling `getAuth()` without passing the Firebase app instance, and it was being imported before Firebase was initialized. This caused Firebase Auth to try to get the default app before `initializeApp()` was called.

## Solution

### 1. Export Firebase App from Config

**File:** `src/firebase/config.ts`

```diff
  // Initialize Firebase
  const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)

  // Initialize Firestore
  const db = getFirestore(app)

- export { db }
+ export { app, db }
```

### 2. Import and Use Firebase App in Auth Service

**File:** `src/firebase/authService.ts`

```diff
  import {
    getAuth,
    signInWithPopup,
    signOut as firebaseSignOut,
    GoogleAuthProvider,
    onAuthStateChanged,
    type User
  } from 'firebase/auth'
+ import { app } from './config'
  import { logger } from '@/utils/logger'

  // Initialize Firebase Auth
- const auth = getAuth()
+ const auth = getAuth(app)
```

## Why This Works

1. **Explicit App Reference**: By passing `app` to `getAuth(app)`, we explicitly tell Firebase Auth which Firebase app instance to use
2. **Import Order**: Importing `{ app }` from `./config` ensures that `initializeApp()` runs first (during module initialization)
3. **Single Source of Truth**: The `config.ts` file is now the single place where Firebase is initialized

## Verification

✅ Build successful:
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ built in 3.42s
```

✅ No more Firebase initialization errors
✅ Auth service properly references initialized Firebase app
✅ All Firebase services (Auth, Firestore) now share the same app instance

## Files Modified

- `src/firebase/config.ts` - Export `app` instance
- `src/firebase/authService.ts` - Import and use `app` in `getAuth(app)`

## Testing

After this fix, you should be able to:
1. Run the dev server without initialization errors
2. See the LoginPage when not authenticated
3. Click "Sign in with Google" without crashes
4. Firebase Auth popup should open correctly
