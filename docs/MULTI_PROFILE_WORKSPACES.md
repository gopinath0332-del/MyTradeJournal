# Multi-Profile Workspaces

## Overview

The Multi-Profile Workspaces feature allows traders to maintain separate, isolated trading environments within a single application. Each profile acts as an independent workspace with its own trades, statistics, and settings, enabling users to:

- **Separate Live vs Paper Trading**: Keep real money trades distinct from practice/paper trading
- **Track Multiple Strategies**: Test and compare different trading strategies independently
- **Manage Multiple Accounts**: Handle different brokers or account types separately
- **Organize by Asset Class or Timeframe**: Create dedicated workspaces for stocks, options, futures, day trading, swing trading, etc.

## Key Features

### 1. Complete Data Isolation
- Each profile maintains its own set of trades
- Statistics and analytics are calculated per-profile
- Switching profiles instantly changes the entire workspace context
- No mixing of data between profiles

### 2. Profile Types
- **Live Trading** üî¥: Real money trading accounts
- **Paper Trading** üìù: Practice/simulation accounts
- **Strategy** üéØ: Specific trading strategy testing
- **Custom** ‚öôÔ∏è: User-defined custom workspaces

### 3. Flexible Configuration
Each profile includes customizable settings:
- Default risk per trade
- Default position size
- Maximum open positions
- Broker information
- Account number
- Display preferences (show in dashboard, include in global stats)

### 4. Visual Distinction
- Custom icons and colors for each profile
- Clear visual indicators in the UI
- Active profile displayed in header
- Profile badges on relevant pages

## User Guide

3. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog
4. **Note**: You cannot delete the last remaining profile

### Profile-Specific Trading

Once a profile is active:
- All new trades automatically tagged with the active profile ID
- Trade history shows only trades from the active profile
- Dashboard statistics reflect only the active profile's data
- Analytics and reports are profile-specific

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model

```typescript
interface Profile {
  id?: string
  name: string
  type: 'live' | 'paper' | 'strategy' | 'custom'
  description?: string
  settings: ProfileSettings
  isActive: boolean
  color?: string
  icon?: string
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
}

interface ProfileSettings {
  defaultRiskPerTrade?: number
  defaultPositionSize?: number
  maxOpenPositions?: number
  strategyName?: string
  strategyVersion?: string
  broker?: string
  accountNumber?: string
  showInDashboard?: boolean
  includeInGlobalStats?: boolean
}
```

### Storage

**Firestore Collections:**
- `profiles`: Stores all profile documents
- `trades`: Each trade document includes a `profileId` field linking to its profile

**LocalStorage:**
- `activeProfileId`: Stores the currently active profile ID for persistence across sessions

### Components

1. **ProfileSelector.vue**: Compact dropdown in header for quick profile switching
2. **ProfileManager.vue**: Full-featured CRUD interface for managing profiles
3. **useProfiles.ts**: Composable providing reactive profile state and management functions

### Services

**profileService.ts**: Firebase operations
- `createProfile()`: Create new profile
- `updateProfile()`: Update profile details
- `deleteProfile()`: Remove profile
- `getAllProfiles()`: Fetch all profiles
- `getActiveProfile()`: Get current active profile
- `setActiveProfile()`: Switch active profile

**tradeService.ts**: Enhanced with profile filtering
- Automatically tags new trades with active `profileId`
- Filters all trade queries by active profile
- Client-side filtering fallback for compatibility

### State Management

The profile system uses Vue 3 Composition API with centralized reactive state:

```typescript
// Global reactive state
const profiles = ref<Profile[]>([])
const activeProfileId = ref<string | null>(null)
const activeProfile = computed(() =>
  profiles.value.find(p => p.id === activeProfileId.value)
)
```

Profile changes emit a global event (`profile-changed`) that components can listen to for automatic data refresh.

## Best Practices

### Organization Strategies

1. **Live vs Paper Split**
   - Create separate profiles for real and paper trading
   - Use consistent naming: "Live - [Broker]" and "Paper - [Purpose]"
   - Keep paper trading profiles inactive when not in use

2. **Strategy Isolation**
   - One profile per trading strategy being tested
   - Include strategy version in advanced settings
   - Document strategy rules in the profile description

3. **Account Segregation**
   - Separate profiles for different brokers or account types
   - Store account numbers in advanced settings
   - Use broker-specific icons for quick identification

4. **Timeframe-Based**
   - Day trading vs swing trading profiles
   - Different risk parameters per timeframe
   - Track performance independently

### Data Management

- **Regular Backups**: Export your Firebase data regularly
- **Profile Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names with context
- **Archive Old Profiles**: Mark completed strategy tests as inactive rather than deleting
- **Global Stats**: Be selective about which profiles contribute to global statistics

### Performance Tips

- Keep the number of active profiles reasonable (< 10)
- Inactive profiles don't impact query performance
- Profile switching reloads data automatically‚Äîno manual refresh needed
- LocalStorage ensures your active profile persists across sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Profile Selector Not Showing
- Check that you're on a desktop viewport (hidden on mobile)
- Ensure profiles have been created
- Verify ProfileSelector component is mounted in App.vue

### Trades Not Filtering by Profile
- Confirm active profile is set (check header dropdown)
- Verify `profileId` exists on trade documents in Firestore
- Check browser console for any profile service errors
- Try switching profiles and back to force refresh

### Cannot Delete Last Profile
- By design, at least one profile must exist
- Create a new profile before deleting the current one
- Or edit the existing profile to repurpose it

### Profile Data Not Persisting
- Check Firebase connection and permissions
- Verify Firestore security rules allow profile read/write
- Check browser LocalStorage is enabled
- Clear cache and reload if profile state seems stale

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

If you have trades created before the multi-profile system:

1. **Automatic Default Profile**
   - A "Default Profile" is created automatically on first load
   - All existing trades without `profileId` are shown in this profile

2. **Migrating Trades** (Optional)
   - Create new profiles for organizing your existing trades
   - (Future feature) Use bulk edit to assign trades to profiles
   - Currently, trades must be manually edited to change their profile

3. **No Data Loss**
   - All existing trades remain intact
   - Trades without `profileId` are accessible when no profile is selected (admin view)
   - Can be assigned to profiles as needed

### Adding to Existing Projects

1. Copy `src/types/profile.ts`
2. Copy `src/firebase/profileService.ts`
3. Copy `src/composables/useProfiles.ts`
4. Copy `src/components/ProfileSelector.vue` and `ProfileManager.vue`
5. Update `src/types/index.ts` to add `profileId?: string` to Trade interface
6. Update `src/firebase/tradeService.ts` with profile filtering logic
7. Add profile routes to `src/router/index.js`
8. Import and integrate `ProfileSelector` in `App.vue`

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the profile system:

- **Profile Analytics**: Compare performance across profiles
- **Bulk Trade Assignment**: Move multiple trades between profiles
- **Profile Export/Import**: Share or backup individual profiles
- **Profile Templates**: Preconfigured profiles for common use cases
- **Profile Tags**: Additional categorization beyond types
- **Profile Permissions**: Read-only or shared profiles for teams
- **Cross-Profile Reports**: Combined analytics across selected profiles
- **Profile Archiving**: Soft delete with restore capability
