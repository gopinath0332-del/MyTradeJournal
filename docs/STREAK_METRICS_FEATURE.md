## Data Structure

### StreakMetrics Interface
```typescript
{
  currentStreak: number
  currentStreakType: 'winning' | 'losing' | 'none'
  longestWinStreak: number
  longestLoseStreak: number
  averageWinStreak: number
  averageLoseStreak: number
  totalWinStreaks: number
  totalLoseStreaks: number
  streakHistory: StreakPeriod[]
}
```

### StreakPeriod Interface
```typescript
{
  type: 'winning' | 'losing'
  length: number
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
  totalPnL: number
}
```

## Calculation Logic

### Streak Detection Algorithm
1. Sort trades by exit date (chronologically)
2. Iterate through trades sequentially
3. Compare each trade's P&L with previous trade
4. Increment streak counter for same type (win/loss)
5. Record streak when type changes
6. Track current, longest, and average streaks
7. Generate streak history for visualization

### Key Metrics
- **Current Streak**: Last consecutive wins or losses
- **Longest Streaks**: Maximum consecutive wins/losses ever
- **Average Streaks**: Mean length of all streaks
- **Streak History**: Complete timeline of all streaks

## User Benefits

### 1. **Pattern Recognition**
- Identify winning and losing patterns
- Understand trading momentum
- Spot emotional trading triggers

### 2. **Risk Management**
- Monitor current losing streaks
- Set alerts for extended losses
- Plan recovery strategies

### 3. **Performance Analysis**
- Compare streaks across symbols
- Evaluate strategy consistency
- Track improvement over time

### 4. **Psychological Insights**
- Recognize tilt indicators
- Manage trading psychology
- Build discipline and consistency

## Integration Points

### Statistics View Tab
- New "Streaks" tab (üî• icon)
- Positioned after "Symbols" tab
- Loads automatically with other statistics
- Year-filtered data

### Data Sources
- Uses existing trade data
- Filtered by selected year
- Real-time updates on data changes
- Cached computations for performance

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Computed Properties**: Reactive calculations only when data changes
2. **Efficient Sorting**: Single sort operation per dataset
3. **Top N Display**: Show only top 10 symbols/strategies
4. **Lazy Loading**: Tab content rendered only when active
5. **Memoization**: Streak history cached for sparkline rendering

## Accessibility Features

1. **Color Coding**: Multiple indicators beyond color
2. **Emoji Icons**: Universal visual indicators
3. **Hover Tooltips**: Detailed information on interaction
4. **Responsive Text**: Readable on all screen sizes
5. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile

## Mobile Optimizations

1. **Card Layout**: Stacked cards instead of tables
2. **Swipeable Tables**: Horizontal scroll with indicators
3. **Larger Touch Targets**: Optimized for finger interaction
4. **Simplified Sparklines**: Reduced complexity on small screens
5. **Adaptive Typography**: Size adjusts based on viewport

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Streak Alerts**: Notifications for specific streak thresholds
2. **Streak Goals**: Set and track personal streak targets
3. **Historical Comparison**: Compare streaks across different periods
4. **Streak Export**: Export streak data for external analysis
5. **Advanced Filters**: Filter streaks by date range, symbol, strategy
6. **Streak Predictions**: ML-based streak continuation probability
