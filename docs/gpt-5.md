# GPT-5 Session Summary (Symbol Drawdown & Lessons Library Enhancements)

_Date: 2025-10-15_

## 1. Objectives Covered
- Repositioned and fixed `WeeklyBreakdown` data loading (added `initializeDashboard()`).
- Implemented innovative `LessonsLibrary.vue` (categorization, tagging, wisdom board, timeline, stats).
- Fixed timeline icon alignment and responsive rendering.
- Added new advanced analytics tab system within `StatisticsView.vue`.
- Implemented `SymbolDrawdownAnalysis.vue` with per-symbol drawdown, recovery, severity metrics.
- Created supporting documentation (`SYMBOL_DRAWDOWN_ANALYSIS.md`, lessons docs) and integrated tab.
- Prepared to extend analysis with losing streak metrics (requested but not yet implemented at time of summary).

## 2. Key Components & Features
### Lessons Library
- Dynamic categorization (Psychology, Strategy, Risk, Process, Execution, Other).
- Tag extraction from free-form lesson text.
- Wisdom Board KPIs: most profitable lesson, biggest loss, total lessons, tag distribution.
- Chronological timeline with improved marker alignment.
- Visual density and responsive layout tuning.

### Symbol Drawdown Analysis
- Groups trades by `symbol` and computes:
  - Peak equity tracking per symbol
  - Max drawdown amount & percentage
  - Current drawdown status (active vs recovered)
  - Recovery duration (days from trough to new peak)
  - Average drawdown across symbols
  - Worst / best performer, fastest recovery
- Severity classification (None / Mild / Moderate / Severe) based on drawdown % thresholds.
- Multi-format UI: overview cards, horizontal bar chart, responsive mobile cards, desktop comparison table.

## 3. Implementation Notes
- Integrated as new tab `{ id: 'symbol-drawdown', label: 'Symbol Drawdown', icon: 'ðŸ“‰' }` in `StatisticsView.vue`.
- Lint fixes: removed trailing spaces, unused vars (`isRecovered`, unused indices).
- Build & type-check passed after each major change.
- Documentation placed in `/docs` with consistent naming and cross-feature references.

## 4. Pending / Next Enhancements
Planned (not yet implemented when this snapshot saved):
- Per-symbol streak metrics:
  - `maxLosingStreak`, `currentLosingStreak`
  - Optional: `maxWinningStreak`, `currentWinningStreak`
  - Streak severity indicators & integration into overview cards/table
- Optional advanced analytics roadmap items (from prior improvement plan): Monte Carlo simulations, volatility-adjusted performance, async worker offloading, caching, strategy tagging refinement.

## 5. Suggested Data Model Extensions for Streaks
Add during symbol aggregation loop:
```js
let currentLose = 0, maxLose = 0, currentWin = 0, maxWin = 0;
for (const trade of sortedTrades) {
  const isLoss = trade.netPnL < 0; // adapt to actual field name
  if (isLoss) {
    currentLose++; maxLose = Math.max(maxLose, currentLose);
    currentWin = 0;
  } else {
    currentWin++; maxWin = Math.max(maxWin, currentWin);
    currentLose = 0;
  }
}
```
Attach to symbol object and surface in UI.

## 6. Quality Status at Snapshot
- Build: PASS (Vite production build succeeded; new chunks for drawdown tab generated)
- Type-check: PASS (`vue-tsc` reported no errors)
- Lint: PASS (post-cleanup; no unused vars or trailing spaces related to new feature)

## 7. Files Added / Modified (Recent Focus)
- `src/components/SymbolDrawdownAnalysis.vue` (new)
- `src/components/StatisticsView.vue` (tab integration + ordering)
- `src/components/LessonsLibrary.vue` (new + CSS refinements)
- Routing updates for lessons (router file) & `App.vue` nav link
- Docs: `SYMBOL_DRAWDOWN_ANALYSIS.md`, `LESSONS_LIBRARY.md`, `LESSONS_SUMMARY.md`, `LESSONS_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`

## 8. Rationale for Ordering
Symbol drawdown analytics introduced before streak metrics to establish baseline risk lens; streaks depend on chronological trade grouping already present in drawdown structure.

## 9. Recommended Immediate Next Step
Implement losing streak metrics in `SymbolDrawdownAnalysis.vue` and update docs to reflect newly exposed behavioral risk indicators.
